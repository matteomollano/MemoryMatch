# MemoryMatch

This project contains the XCode build and source code for my Memory Match Game, created using storyboard and Swift.

The user interface of this app is designed using:
- a 4-by-5 view of UIButtons
- two UILabels to display the Moves Left and Moves Made by the user

The objective of this Memory Match game is to quickly determine whether a card symbol matches the one presented two times previously.

The game's implementation can be found in MemoryModel.swift and ViewController.swift
